# T20-Cricket-Analysis
**Objective**
The primary objective of this project is to analyze T20 cricket performance data to identify the top 11 players based on their statistical contributions. Utilizing advanced data analysis techniques in Python and visualizations in Power BI, this project aims to provide insights into player performance, aiding team selection and strategy formulation.

**Methodology:**
1. Data Collection: Gathered extensive T20 cricket match data, including player statistics (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy rate, etc.) from reputable sources.
2. Data Cleaning and Preparation: Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Python libraries (Pandas, NumPy) to ensure accuracy and consistency.
3. Analysis: Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that correlate with successful T20 performance. Employed statistical techniques and algorithms to evaluate player performance metrics and compare them across different matches and tournaments.
4. Visualization: Created interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize player statistics, performance trends, and comparative analysis. Generated graphs and charts to highlight top-performing players and their contributions.
5. Player Selection: Developed a scoring model to rank players based on their overall performance metrics. Identified the top 11 players who excelled in various categories, providing a balanced team selection for optimal performance.

**Results**
The analysis resulted in the identification of a top 11 player lineup, showcasing the playersâ€™ strengths and potential impact in T20 matches.
Insights from the project were visually represented in an interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing stakeholders to explore player performances dynamically.

**Conclusion** 
This project demonstrates the power of data analysis and visualization in sports. By leveraging Python and Power BI, we effectively identified top-performing players in T20 cricket, providing valuable insights for team selection and strategy. The approach can be adapted for further analysis in other formats of cricket or sports.
